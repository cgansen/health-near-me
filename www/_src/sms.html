  <h2>Find Health Providers via Text Messaging</h2>
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>You can search healthnear.me with any phone that sends and received text messages. Here's how.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>
        Text your search to <a href="tel://3125483951">312-548-3951</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Your message should include a search term, like "services" or "warming center", then the word "near", then an address or location.</p>
      <p>
        Some samples:
        <dl>
          <dt>All services near Wrigley Field</dt>
          <dd>"services near wrigley field"</dd>
          
          <dt>Warming centers near Ashland and Lake Street</dt>
          <dd>"warming center near ashland at lake st"</dd>
          
          <dt>Condom distributors near 2133 South Dearborn Street</dt>
          <dd>"condoms near 2133 s dearborn st"</dd>
        </dl>
      </p></li>
      
      <li><p>Wait a few seconds.</p></li>
      
      <li><p>See the results came back, ordered by distance from the location you provided.</p></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>SMS Tips</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Always include as precise an address as possible.</li>
      <li>Always separate the search term and address with the word "<strong>near</strong>"; that's how the machines know what to search for and where.</li>
      <li>Text "<strong>list services</strong>" to get a list of all services the system knows about.</li>
      <li>Text "<strong>STOP</strong>" to block any future messages from healthnear.me, or "<strong>START</strong>" to resume. We use Twilio to deliver messages; read about <a href="https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/sms/does-twilio-support-stop-block-and-cancel-aka-sms-filtering">the commands they support</a>.</li>
