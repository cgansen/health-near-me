          HealthNear.Me is a simple tool for people in Chicago to find public health providers near them.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          There are a million ways to use the Internet to find a good restaurant or a place to get your oil 
          changed nearby, but very few to locate much needed health services in your area, such as a mental 
          health or WIC clinic. Existing tools are typically based on a single type of provider, don't work 
          well on mobile devices, and are not searchable by location. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
          HealthNear.me aggregates nine types of public health providers in one place and makes them searchable, either
          by this website, which is built to work on smart phones, tablets, and old fashioned desktop computers, or via
          <a href="#/sms">any phone that can send and receive text messages</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          This application started as an entry in the 
          <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/illinois-public-health-datapalooza-and-a-10k-challenge/">
            Making Public Health Data Work Challenge</a>. The creators, Chris Gansen and Melissa Buenger, are working with
            the Chicago Department of Public Health to pilot and deploy this tool in 2014.
        </p>
